   <h1> FROM RAGS TO RICHES: INSPIRING STORIES</h1>

    <h4>
        We always tend to blame our luck when we cannot achieve anything. Here
        are a few inspiring stories of people who were not born with a silver spoon
        but will surely die with a silver spoon!.
    </h4>






<h1>1. MAHASHAY DHARAMPAL GULATI</h1>


<h3>From a simple Tonga driver to raising a brand. What started as a small spice
    shop in 1919 in the city of Sialkot in Pakistan, worth millions today. A
    business started by his father is now an empire with not just the spice
    factory, but hospitals and schools as well. This is the rags to riches story of
    Mahashay Dharampal Gulati-a school dropout, a Tonga driver, and the
    creator of MDH.He was born and raised in Sialkot, in Pakistan. He left
    school in 5th standard in 1933 and tried his luck in various other businesses
    but didn't work out.In 1947, when Gulati's family moved to India during
    Partition, they reached a refugee camp in Amritsar before moving to Delhi in
    a flat with no electricity, water or toilet facilities. On moving to Delhi, his
    father handed him Rs. 1500; Rs. 630 of which was used to buy a Tonga.
    Tonga didn't earn him much so he sold his vehicle to buy a small space for
    the business of spices. In 1953, he rented a shop at Chandni Chowk and in
    1959 he bought a plot of land in Kirti Nagar and set up a spice factory. His
    personal philosophy was "Give to the world thc best you can and the rest
    will comc back to you automatically." He might be a 5th-grade dropout, but
    his salary was worth crores. With an 80% stake in the company, he didn't
    retire even in his 90s and continued to take business decisions.MDH is an
    empire today. It has been a journey from a spice shop to a 250-bed hospital,
    a mobile hospital for slum dwellers and morc than 20 schools. With a range
    of 62 products in over 150 different packages, MDH stands as a motivation
    and Mahashay Dharampal Gulati as the face behind the motivation.
    Unfortunately, Mahashay Dharampall Gulati passed away, leaving behind a
    legacy and decades of what success look like.

    year's salary on my plane ticket to the US so I could attend Stanford. It was
    my first time ever on a plane...America was expensive. A phone call back
