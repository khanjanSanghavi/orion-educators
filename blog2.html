<h1>
    ARE YOU DEPRESSED OR JUST SAD?
</h1>
<br>

<h4>
Many people confuse sadness with depression but the alike sounding terms are totally different from
each other. Depression is when you shouted loud but no one heard you. Depression is when you start
losing interest in your favourite activities. Depression is when you start to stay away from your loved
ones. While sadness is just a temporary feeling. In this modern world where families are getting smaller
and facebook friend circles are getting larger ; depression is very common. People are getting less
concerned about each other and prefer to judge each other. As a wise man once said "We should stop
expecting people to be nice with us because we were nice to them. It's like expecting a lion to not to kill
you because you didn't kill him." Depression is a sign of static understanding about life. When you feel
everything in life is dead, static, there is nothing more, nowhere to go, that is when one gets depressed.
When things don't work the way we wanted them to work; we get disappointed. Our mind tortures us
by reminding about our failures and bad incidents. This leads to depression. But how can we stop
thinking about those incidents and failures? Ask yourself.
HOW TO DEAL WITH DEPRESSION?
You have got to start thinking like you're blessed, talking like you're blessed and acting like you're
blessed. That's how blessings get activated.

<h1>
    1. HAVE A GOOD ROUTINE
</h1>

<h2>
    • Have a sound sleep of 8+ hours. It may be difficult at first to sleep early but soon  you will   get habitual
    to it.
    • Drink 2L minimum of water a day
    • Get sun daily
    • No sugar
    • Read 30 minutes daily
    • workout 3X/ week
    • Eat fruits and green vegetables
    • Meditate for 10 minutes daily.
</h2>


<h1>2. TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS , RELATIVES OR PARENTS</h1>

<h2>
    Share your feelings with someone whom you trust. If you share your feelings you will feel lighter. It may
    sound difficult at first but try it once as it really works. You may feel that if you share your sadness with
    your loved ones they may get tensed about you. But this is just a illusion that your brain has made.
</h2>

<h1>3. READ INSPIRATIONAL BOOKS AND WATCH MOTIVATIONAL VIDEOS</h1>

<h2>
    If you still don't feel like sharing your thoughts with anyone ; you can watch some amazing
    MOTIVATIONAL VIDEOS on YouTube. You can even read inspirational books. You can read Bhagwad Gita
    irrespective of your religion. Its not just a religious book ; its a way of living. You can even try out some
    other inspirational books.
</h2>

<h1>4. CHANGE THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU</h1>

<h2>
    Sometimes you may be depressed because of the surroundings in which you are. If a seed couldn't turn
    into a plant its not because of seed, its because the seed is in wrong environment. Go out and socialize.
    Make new friends who know lesser about your past. If you can't change the people around you, change
    the people around you!
</h2>

<h1>5. TRAVEL OR DO WHAT YOU LOVE!</h1>

<h2>
    • Travelling is the best way to overcome any problem. Roads have answers to your every question. You
    will meet new people, new roads and new destinations. Try out some nature oriented travel
    destinations.
    • You can also try to pick up the things you loved again even if you think you don't have enough time to
    do that. People are never too busy, its just about their priorities. You can pick up your old hobbies.
    6. EXERCISE OR PICK UP YOUR FAVOURITE SPORT
    •If you are good at sports; play your favourite sport. And even if you are not! Start to learn! As rome
    wasn't build in a day. Even the hardest pain disappears when you play sports. Thats why people rate
    sports much more than anything.
    • If sports is not your cup of tea. Start to exercise on daily basis. You may feel fatigue at first but this
    would really help!
</h2>

<h1>7. COOK</h1>
<h2>You can make delicious food for yourself! Cook happy foods and make yourself happy! Eat chocolates,
    ice cream, fruits, etc. Make good healthy salad for yourself! Learn to cook.
    </h2>

    <h1>8. KNOW AND LOVE YOURSELF</h1>


<h2>You are never your own original version. You perceive yourself as people perceive you. Never copy
    anyone. Know your own interests and know yourself. Spend some time with yourself and find out what
    you really want. Keep your devices aside and think about yourself for only 10 minutes a day. Talk to
    yourself! Talking to yourself isn’t just normal, it’s good for your mental health — if you have the right conversations.</h2>


    <h1>9. WORK ON YOUR PROS</h1>
    <h2>Dont be jack of all trades master of none. Work on what you are good at. If you work on something you
        are not good at , it may make you more depressed. As Bruce Lee said ," I fear not the man who has
        practice 10,000 kicks at once, but I fear the man who has practice one kick 10,000 times."
        10. LISTEN TO SOME GOOD MUSIC OR PODCASTS OR WATCH SOME INSPIRATIONAL MOVIES.
        • Music is not just some pleasant sound but an amazing feeling. You can listen to your favourite songs.
        You can play some inspirational songs.
        • You can listen to some life related podcasts or watch movies like pursuit of happyness ,Zindagi na
        milegi dobara, dear zindagi, Forest Gump , etc. This would really change your perspective about life.
        # Even after trying all this things you still don't feel good, it is highly recommended to SEEK SOME
        PROFESSIONAL HELP. Seeking professional help may be difficult for some people as the society still
        doesn't understand depression really. But society will always judge no matter what you do. So go for it.

    <h3>At the end of the day, its your life. As a wise man once said:
        " LIFE ISN'T MEAN TO BE EASY , ITS MEAN TO BE LIVED. SOMETIMES HAPPY, OTHER TIMES
        ROUGH...BUT EVERY UP AND DOWN YOU LEARN LESSONS THAT MAKE YOU STRONG"</h3>
